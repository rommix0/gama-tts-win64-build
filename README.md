# gama-tts-win64-build
Windows 64-bit build of mym-br/gama_tts and mym-br/gama_tts_editor

Has been built with MSYS2 in Windows 10 (might work with other 64-bit systems like Windows 7).

Just simply download, extract, and use! Enjoy!

NOTE (6/17/2023): Set Frames/Period to 1024 in QJackCtl. Otherwise the "parameter modification" window will crash when used. Courtesy of @mym-br.
